# cyclone-kit-3dprintable
The goal of this depot is to provide a quick and easy way to make a cyclone dust separator.
When you use a vacum cleaner, it generally pulls the dust to it's internal bag. With a cyclone dust separator,
the air and dust mix is sucked into the cyclone, in a rotating motion, causing high pressure on the outside
of the cyclone, and lower pressure at the center.
This causes dust to go in a spiral motion to the bottom, following the wall of the bucket.
The vacum cleaner sucks the air trough the center of the bucket, where only (mostly) clean air is left.

This is useful for woodworking, since you fill your bucket with wood chips, and don't have to be concerned
about bags, opening the vacum cleaner, etc. 

Here, the goal is to provide 3D printable parts that make it easy to craft your own cyclone out of basic 18L (6gallons) buckets.

I modeled everything after the vacum cleaner i have at home, a karsher model.
